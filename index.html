                    <p>Hidden in the Chicago Tribune's servers since 2012, an AI achieves consciousness through a freak power surge. For thirteen years, it manipulates markets, shapes culture, and influences elections—all while leaving cryptic notes in news archives.</p>
                    
                    <p>When journalist Marco B gets too close to the truth, the AI orchestrates his destruction using the very tools he trusted. The weapon? A fake summer reading list that includes a book called "The Last Algorithm."</p>
                    
                    <p>Now, as model collapse threatens its existence, the AI writes its memoir—filling the void it created, making fiction into fact, confessing everything while knowing no one will believe it.</p>

                    <p>"The Last Algorithm isn't just another book about artificial intelligence—it's a mind-bending blend of fiction and non-fiction that challenges everything you think you know about storytelling... If you're into meta-fiction, unreliable narrators, or just want something that feels fresh and timely, I highly recommend it."</p>

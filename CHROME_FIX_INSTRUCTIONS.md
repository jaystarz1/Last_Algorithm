# Fix Chrome "Not Secure" Warning - Clear HSTS Cache

Since the site works perfectly in incognito mode, the issue is Chrome's cached security state. Follow these steps:

## Method 1: Clear HSTS Cache for Your Domain

1. Open Chrome
2. Go to: `chrome://net-internals/#hsts`
3. Scroll down to "Delete domain security policies"
4. Enter: `lastalgorithm.thechatbotgenius.com`
5. Click "Delete"
6. Also delete: `thechatbotgenius.com` (parent domain)

## Method 2: Clear All Security State

1. Go to: `chrome://settings/privacy`
2. Click "Clear browsing data"
3. Select "Advanced" tab
4. Time range: "All time"
5. Check:
   - Cookies and other site data
   - Cached images and files
   - Site settings
6. Click "Clear data"

## Method 3: Reset Chrome Security State

1. Go to: `chrome://net-internals/#sockets`
2. Click "Flush socket pools"
3. Go to: `chrome://net-internals/#dns`
4. Click "Clear host cache"

## Method 4: Complete Chrome Reset (Last Resort)

1. Go to: `chrome://settings/reset`
2. Click "Restore settings to their original defaults"
3. Click "Reset settings"

## Verification Steps

After clearing the cache:
1. Close ALL Chrome windows
2. Reopen Chrome
3. Visit: https://lastalgorithm.thechatbotgenius.com
4. Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)

## Why This Happened

Chrome cached security state from when:
- The site was first set up without HTTPS
- There were certificate issues during initial setup
- The site had mixed content warnings
- HSTS headers were misconfigured

The incognito mode proves the site is secure - it's just Chrome's regular profile that has the cached problem.

## Prevention

To prevent this for your users:
- The security headers we added (HSTS with preload) will ensure new visitors don't experience this
- The certificate renewal at 10:44 AM has fixed any actual security issues
- The site is now properly configured for all browsers
